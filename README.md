# Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
*Jim Carrey's magnum opus*
---
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind arguably is Jim Carrey's greatest work in my humble opinion. The film is directed by Michael Gondry, starring Jim Carrey as Joel Barish and Kate Winslet as Clementine Kruczynski. The movie is a drama about Joel (Jim Carrey) discovers that his ex girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet) has undergone a procedure to have her memories of him erased.
